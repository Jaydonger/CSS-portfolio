# CSS-portfolio
description

This is my CSS portfolio. This website gives a brief description of who I am and showcases repositories that I have created and turned into live sites that you can visit! Click on any of the images within the working repositories section to visit them. At the bottom you will find links to my Linkedin and also my Email so that you may contact me if necessary.
